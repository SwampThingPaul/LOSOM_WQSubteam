## Project Information

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is re-evaluating Lake Okeechobee operations to coincide with the
completion of Herbert Hoover Dike (HHD) rehabilitation in 2022. This study will re-examine the opportunities
to balance the project purposes for flood control, water supply, navigation, recreation, and preservation of fish and
wildlife resources. The result will be the Lake Okeechobee System Operating Manual (LOSOM). The LOSOM study
will also consider the future Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) infrastructure that will provide
additional flexibility for lake operation.
